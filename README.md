# VitalShift
A mod that changes your avatar based on your health, also adds some other features.
Last tested on Melonloader 0.6.5, BoneLab patch 6.

## Current Features
- Avatar Switching based on health, useful to get visual damage to your avatar if used with specific avatar mods.
- Getting knocked down, if you get knocked or die, you will just wake up right where you fell instead of dying like normal.
- Disible automatic healing, can be fun if you get a health pickup mod.
