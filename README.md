# VitalShift
A mod that changes your avatar based on your health, also adds some other features.

PC is untested!
Last tested on Melonloader 0.6.5, BoneLab patch 6.

## Current Features
- Avatar Switching based on health, useful to get visual damage to your avatar if used with specific avatar mods.
- Getting knocked down, if you get knocked, you will just wake up right where you fell instead of dying like normal, if you get hit again while you are still knocked, you die like normal.

## Recommended mods
Avatars with damage states, this is mine: [VitalShift Avatar Pack](https://mod.io/g/bonelab/m/vitalshift)
